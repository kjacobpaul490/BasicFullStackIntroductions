You can specify background images<br>
for any visible HTML element.<br>
In this example, the background image<br>
is specified for a p element.<br>
By default, the background-image<br>
will repeat itself in the direction(s)<br>
where it is smaller than the element<br>
where it is specified. (Try resizing the<br>
browser window to see how the<br>
background image behaves.
